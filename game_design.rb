# looks like the demo is using 4 routes
# new_game # gets name
# bet # makes wager
# game # is game play display cards and total
# start over in the nav bar
# click to view dealers next cards, I don't like
# most of the activity is on the game
# displaying cards is nice
# displaying running total of amount won or lost
# play again?
# game_over displays two different things one if
# you go bust and another if you quit before
# display bet outcomes and amounts
